This is the initial project set up for a MERN Stack application using docker.

See the README File for details. You will need to replace the references to the the YouTube Clone name in the following files.

- README.md
- app.js
- Docker-compose.yml
- Server.js

This project will require you to insert the appropriate Mongo Atlas URI connection string in the /backend/.env file.

Remember to clone into and set up your GIT repository manually, but the .gitingore is preserved for ease.
